        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We are a team of undergraduates set out to make easily accessible napping spots a reality on campus.
            Our diverse academic background allows insights from multiple perspectives to the problem and also provides us with the skillset to successfully tackle it. <br><br>
            <i>"When I am tired while attending classes or completing
                homework on campus, I want an accessible, comfortable
                and ideally private space to take a power nap, so that I can
                enhance my productivity and get my work done effectively."</i>
